## PayloadsAllTheThings

Vulcn can fetch payloads from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), a comprehensive collection of security payloads.

```bash
vulcn run session.vulcn.yml --payload payloadbox:xss
```

Available PayloadBox types:

| Type                | Description                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `xss`               | XSS payloads               |
| `sql-injection`     | SQL injection payloads     |
| `xxe`               | XXE payloads               |
| `command-injection` | Command injection payloads |
| `open-redirect`     | Open redirect payloads     |
| `path-traversal`    | Path traversal payloads    |

## Custom Payloads

Create your own payload file:

```yaml
# my-payloads.yml
version: "1"
payloads:
  - name: my-xss-payloads
    category: xss
    description: Custom XSS payloads for my application
    payloads:
      - "<script>alert(document.domain)</script>"
      - "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"
      - "javascript:alert(1)"
    detectPatterns:
      - "alert\\("

  - name: my-sqli-payloads
    category: sqli
    description: Custom SQLi payloads
    payloads:
      - "' OR '1'='1"
      - "1; DROP TABLE users--"
      - "1 UNION SELECT * FROM users"
```

Use with `--payload-file`:

```bash
vulcn run session.vulcn.yml --payload-file ./my-payloads.yml
```

Or configure in `vulcn.config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: "@vulcn/plugin-payloads"
    config:
      builtin: true
      files:
        - ./my-payloads.yml
```
